# IOT2
Simulation
for this we need to make a Simulation circuit to drive 6 servo motor
we have 2 option 
1- we use the Arduino UNO and 6 Potentiometer and a bread board  to control the motor the Potentiometer is connected to arduino board via analog input and then via the pwm ports is the output which is connected to the servo motor and each motor is controlled  via 1 Potentiometer(we can use the usb for power for now at least)
parts:
serv motor*6
Potentiometer*6
arduino UNO 3
breadboard
wires 
2- we can use board that have wifi capability such as the Esp series and use an IOT platform such as blynk to control the motors
parts:
serv motor*6
ESP32
breadboard
wires 
*note for now we are using power from the usb which is 5 volt for both ways
